__Bash Scripting Lessons__
==========================

By: _Jstith_

 ### Purpose

 This repository holds a series of lessons designed for the USCGA Cyber Team as an introduction to general bash fluency and bash scripting. This does *not* explain the basics of the command line. My general expectation is that everyone doing these lessons have at least run through John Hammond's Training Wheels. These lessons will be useful for learning about log analysis in the future, as well as for general scripting in competitions.

 ### Roadmap

- Lesson 1: Shortcuts
  - Focuses on keyboard shortcuts to write in bash more quickly and look like a real 1337 hacker. Speed is key, and getting good at these shortcuts will go a long way.
  - Screen movements
    - ctl-L
    - Terminator?
  - Cursor movements
    - general ctl vs alt
    - ctl-A
    - ctl-E
    - ctl-F
    - ctl-B
    - alt-F
    - alt-B
    - ctl-L
  - Text editing
    - ctl-D
    - ctl-T
    - alt-T
    - alt-L
    - alt-U
  - Cut and paste commands
    - ctl-K
    - ctl-U
    - alt-D
    - alt-Backspace
    - ctl-Y
  - Masks?
    - Differentiate regex?

- Lesson 2: Basic Bash Script
  - Walks through creating your first couple of bash scripts, and highlights some of the benefits of making bash scripts rather than just running commands one at a time.
